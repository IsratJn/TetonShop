# Automation of TetonShop Website

It contains and complete workflow of a new user from landing on website -> login -> Add a certain product to cart -> go to cart -> go to checkout -> Selecting shipping
information(home delivery) -> creating new address -> go to payment method page(COD) -> place order -> go to All Orders page ->getting the first orderIdNo -> go to edit orders page 
-> canceling the first order.

I have implemented **Page Object Model(POM)**
